      <content:encoded>&lt;img src="https://blog.nem.io/content/images/2021/06/Congratulations-to-Ignite-Cohort-1-1080x1080.png" alt="NEM Ignite Incubator Program Supports Three Early-Stage Projects on Symbol"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re excited to announce that the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://nemventures.io/" rel="noopener"&gt;NEM Ventures&lt;/a&gt; team has successfully incubated three blockchain startups on &lt;a href="http://symbolplatform.com/" rel="noopener"&gt;Symbol&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href="https://www.nemventures.io/ignite-incubator/" rel="noopener"&gt;NEM Ignite Incubator Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEM Ventures launched NEM Ignite earlier this year to help early-stage startups develop their project and deliver on their vision via 1:1 tailored mentoring with the NEM Executive team and ecosystem. The first cohort of the program was a resounding success, fostering productive connections between participants, industry partners and professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to share that &lt;a href="https://lcnem.com/" rel="noopener"&gt;LCNEM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://karmapoint.cl/en" rel="noopener"&gt;KarmaPoint&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://factorchain.ai/" rel="noopener"&gt;FactorChain AI&lt;/a&gt;, three promising projects spanning several continents and disciplines, have concluded the inaugural phase of the program. Find more details about these startups below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japanese startup &lt;a href="https://lcnem.com/" rel="noopener"&gt;LCNEM&lt;/a&gt; fosters the growth of smart cities via blockchain, AI and machine learning technology. They are currently building a ticket management and tracking product for the Japanese entertainment industry as well as a stablecoin backed by the Japanese Yen. Overall, LCNEM’s powerful tech stack helps to build smart cities where individuals can focus on creating value, backed by an accomplished team that also provides digital experience consulting.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The second project in development on Symbol is &lt;a href="https://karmapoint.cl/" rel="noopener"&gt;KarmaPoint&lt;/a&gt;, a Chilean-based startup. The project incentivizes users to carry out positive acts, rewarding them with digital tokens. The system creates a digital reputation for people and institutions in recognition of their contributions to society, improving collaboration and motivation in a virtuous cycle of positive value. The project has recently finished Beta version testing with great results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://factorchain.ai/" rel="noopener"&gt;FactorChain AI&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian project initially geared towards local artisanal food providers and craft breweries, allows for smarter, faster credit into the supply chain. FactorChain accesses banking, financial and operational data to score borrowers and automate the onboarding and underwriting process. The project utilizes smart contracts that track the progress of credit issuance, and underwrite the credit through alternative pools of capital, redirecting DeFi yield from stablecoin backed investments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sharing his thoughts on the first cohort of NEM Ignite, Dave Hodgson, CIO of NEM Group and MD of NEM Ventures said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;NEM Ignite fosters connections between cohort participants, industry partners and professionals, giving incubatees access to the strong and thriving decentralized NEM ecosystem and beyond. The program has given us the opportunity to expand our ecosystem with three projects. APAC, Latin America and North America are three highly-valued demographics, and we believe that these startups have the potential to contribute to the vision of building a decentralized new economy movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to welcome LCNEM, KarmaPoint and FactorChain AI to the NEM ecosystem! Together, these diverse projects will contribute to the growth of our distributed ecosystem and vision for building a new economy movement (NEM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more updates, and be sure to visit us at &lt;a href="https://nemventures.io/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NEM Ventures&lt;/a&gt;, and follow us on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NEMofficial" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for all of the latest NEM and Symbol news.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <title>What if The Food You Eat is Fake?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;They have heard about fake cosmetics, fake bags, and fake medicines, but have they thought about fake food? Recently on April 2021, a Malaysian influencer known as Khairul Aming discovered that his ‘sambal’ product was counterfeited.&amp;#46;&amp;#46;&amp;#46;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io/food-eat-fake/"&gt;What if The Food You Eat is Fake?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io"&gt;NEM News Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;They have heard about &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/how-to-fight-against-the-spread-of-fake-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fake cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, fake bags, and &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/harms-of-counterfeit-medicine-think-twice-before-buying/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fake medicines&lt;/a&gt;, but have they thought about fake food?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently on April 2021, a Malaysian influencer known as Khairul Aming discovered that his ‘sambal’ product was &lt;a href="https://coconuts.co/kl/food-drink/popular-foodie-khairul-aming-discovers-gross-fake-versions-of-his-sambal-nyet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;counterfeited&lt;/a&gt;. ‘Sambal’ is basically mashed or blended cillies, typically mixed with shallots or some other flavor-enhancing ingredients. It is a very common dish to be served alongside the main meals in Malaysia and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the ‘sambal’ was faked, not in terms of turning out to be something other than food. The buyers still get chilies in jars, but the buyers were tricked into believing that they purchased the ‘sambal’ produced by Khairul Aming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a fake side dish doesn’t sound that bad, does it? However, do you know that even &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/5-surprising-daily-products-counterfeited-in-malaysia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;formula milk for babies&lt;/a&gt; also gets counterfeited? Imagine spending hours researching the product with the best ingredients to fit your baby’s needs, just to find out that they gave your vulnerable baby fake powder milk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Danish formula milk brand, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://vn-en.lets-eco.store/we-are-an-online-milk-farm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let’s Eco&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;, uses &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/case_study/counterfeit-and-product-verification-smart-packaging-consumer-engagement-big-data-insight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BrandTag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; to ensure the customers receive genuine products.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What to Expect From Fake Food&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84826 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fake-Food-1.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="691" height="277" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with fake food products is the fact that when they can lie about the brand, they can lie about practically anything, especially the ingredients, manufacturing process, and quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s discuss the risks of consuming fake food products in detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Questionable Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumers would be lucky if the counterfeiter uses the same ingredients. If they do use the same raw materials, most likely cheaper and lower quality ones were chosen to get maximum profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The less preferable case is the counterfeiters replace the ingredients with synthetic colorings, flavorings, or powder to achieve a similar taste and texture to the original. In the worst-case scenario, they use illegal ingredients that may harm the consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Unknown Quality Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, they buy a food product because of the guarantee of the cleanliness and quality control involved in the product’s makings, such as handled by workers who wear gloves, product sealing, and using filtered water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in Khairul Aming’s case, the product founder already guaranteed that all of his ‘sambals’ are freshly made every single day to ensure his customers get to enjoy his product for a long period. That was why one of the fake ‘sambal’ buyers was very disappointed to find the product he received in a stale, inedible condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Shady Halal Status&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Muslims, the Halal guarantee is very important, as it is related to their faith. Asking &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/muslim-consumer-is-this-product-halal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;‘is this product halal?&lt;/a&gt;’ will be the first thing in making a choice in food product purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, Halal refers to clean food that is not mixed with ingredients forbidden in Islam, typically swine or unslaughtered animals. Consuming non-Halal food is believed to contaminate and weaken the Muslim faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why any news on Halal fraud will cause outrage to Muslim consumers, such as the Halal meat cartel scandal discussed in &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/luxtag-participated-in-the-bvms-blockchain-awareness-program-addressing-halal-meat-cartel-scandal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;BV@M’s Blockchain Awareness Program&lt;/a&gt; in which LuxTag participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Downgrading The Original Brand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterfeits may not only harm the consumers, but they also inflicted damage to the original brand’s reputation, especially if the consumers relate the bad quality of the fake products to the original Brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, the original brand has to bear the loss of revenue that is supposed to come from the purchasers of the counterfeited products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="topic_2" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to Avoid Fake Food&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84825 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fake-Food-4.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can avoid consuming fake food products by being careful in your purchase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always opt to &lt;strong&gt;buy from the official store&lt;/strong&gt; or reseller listed by the brand’s website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always &lt;strong&gt;compare the products&lt;/strong&gt; you are buying with the product listed on the brand’s website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check product packaging for silly errors&lt;/strong&gt;, such as typos, misaligned, or weirdly proportioned visuals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scan the barcode or QR code&lt;/strong&gt; on the packaging to check its validity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They can also use &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BrandTag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; to check a product’s authenticity.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_1_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="topic_3" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How to Protect Your Products from Counterfeiters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84824 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Fake-Food-3.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of taking down counterfeiters does not fall onto the customer’s shoulders only. As a brand owner, they must take all precautions to discourage counterfeiters from aiming at their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Patent &amp;#38; Legal Register&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first step is the most crucial protection of their brand. No matter how popular they already are and how sophisticated their product packaging is, if their product is not yet patented, they cannot take any legal actions towards the people who counterfeit their product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was what &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/product-citizenship-good-citizen-bad-citizen/#who-are-bad-citizen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;MHAM experienced when their product went viral&lt;/a&gt;, whereby an entity started producing identical products then claimed MHAM as a counterfeit brand. The issue was only resolved once MHAM officially registered its product under the Malaysian Ministry of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Product Citizenship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/product-citizenship-give-your-products-an-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Product Citizenship&lt;/a&gt; is basically granting unique identities to their products with the implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/product-citizenship-series-how-to-implement-smart-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;smart packaging&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, smart packaging is a packaging method to improve the quality of the contents or to enable interaction with the consumers. An example of a smartly packaged product is a product printed with a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This way, their customers can easily verify the authenticity of their products simply by scanning their packaging. They can give the identities by batch, type, or variations. However, the more specific it is, the more secure their products will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can DIY their own smart packaging, Luxtag conducted a free webinar to demonstrate how they can do so! Learn about the webinar &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/luxtag-organized-an-international-webinar-on-product-citizenship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Track &amp;#38; trace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/track-trace-all-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Tracking and tracing&lt;/a&gt; their smartly packaged products will help them to efficiently notice any unusual activities that may indicate counterfeit activity, such as having one product ID be scanned more than a hundred times within a short duration or from random locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Make your customers aware of your smart packaging &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having smart packaging is pointless if nobody scans or realizes it. They can try these &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/3-easy-ways-to-attract-customers-to-scan-your-product-qr-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;three simple tips&lt;/a&gt; to ensure the consumers scan their products: make it obvious, make it rewarding, and include reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Raise counterfeit awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to their survey, 4 out of 10 people bought counterfeits even though they know that they are purchasing fake products. That being said, there may be some people who admire their brand but opt to purchase the counterfeits due to the lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, they should make the effort to raise awareness on how counterfeit is harming the brand, the industry, and the growth of innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_2_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="topic_4" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;An Anti-Counterfeit Solution for Both Consumer and Brands&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84412 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brandtag-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="567" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.brandtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;BrandTag&lt;/a&gt; to the rescue! BrandTag is a Software-as-a-Solution (SaaS) that allows their products to announce authenticity through their smart packaging and protect themselves from being counterfeited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a brand owner, they will experience these things when they use BrandTag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authenticity verification&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the customers have to do is scan the QR code! They don’t need to take a picture or inspect the products before emailing them to their to ensure the product’s authenticity. They will save a lot of resources on customer services!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real-time product insights&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will see real-time analysis of the scanning activities of their products, including frequency &amp;#38; location. They can use this information to tailor their marketing and focus on the preferences of those more popular places or products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engage &amp;#38; Promote&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can include the product’s story, latest promotion, customer reward program, vouchers, and their 5-star ratings. The customers have no chance to hesitate in making a purchase!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customization &amp;#38; Consistency for Bulk ProductionThey &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They decide what their customers will see. They can customize the color, theme, roduct image, and more so that they’ll suit their brand. Plus, they only have to do it once! While every single product has its own unique QR code, it’ll still maintain the same image that reflects a particular series or batch.&lt;/p&gt;

They will include digital collectibles of some of the world’s most famous and celebrated sports stars, including Sir Kenny Dalglish   and Riyad Mahrez, bringing fans the chance to own a piece of sporting history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collections will contain the first-ever digital collectible of football legend Sir Kenny Dalglish, one of the biggest legends in Liverpool FC’s history. He’s the winner of many trophies as both player and manager, being the first Liverpool manager to win the league and cup double in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Riyad Mahrez is one of the best African football players of all time and has been instrumental in taking Manchester City to the 2020/21 Champions League final for the first time in its history. He was also fundamental in Leicester’s historic Premier League victory in the 2015/2016 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These digital collectibles will be the vehicle to bring together two of the best football talents of all time to a legion of worldwide fans — a passion that goes beyond team preferences. A new generation of football fans will have at the tip of their fingers amazing digital memorabilia of historical players from yesterday and today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="symbol-mosaics"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol mosaics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbol mosaics represent how decentralized technologies can combine digital and physical memorabilia to create unique digital collections for consumers. With COVID-19 preventing fans from seeing their favorite teams, athletes and events for months, Symbol mosaics offer a new technology for people to connect with top sports stars and athletes through new digital formats supported by decentralized technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEMs capabilities for creating digital collectibles on Symbol will unleash a revolution in the creator economy, for music, art, and sport. Fans will be able to purchase memorabilia, collectibles, digital works, and other unique works and benefit from a seamless, intuitive interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is on delivering a premium product experience that will bring fans and supporters closer to the brands and icons they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="nem-symbol-the-blockchain-for-tokenization-and-digitization-of-assets"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEM Symbol, the blockchain for tokenization and digitization of assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbol, the NEM blockchain, was created specifically for asset digitization and tokenization. Features such as mosaics – which are digital tokens with customisable properties that can represent any unit of value – bring creators and consumers closer to everything they need in order to participate in the tokenized economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mike Sotirakos, Managing Director of NEM Software has commented, “&lt;em&gt;With hundreds of millions of fans globally, Symbol provides the ability for athletes to share their stories directly through a next-generation collectible platform. Blockchain technology enables us to bring creators and consumers closer together with the goal of promoting access and inclusion to an entirely new tokenized economy – and we’re excited for NEM to be at the forefront of that.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbol is the next step towards the mainstream adoption of blockchain. By enabling the efficient creation of digital assets, Symbol is helping to integrate decentralized technology into people’s everyday lives by digitizing and tokenizing the things they love, and ensuring a fairer value exchange for all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io/rich-nfts/"&gt;How to Get Rich With NFTs?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io"&gt;NEM News Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_0 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They thought that 10 years ago online video calls are only for rich people. What do they know, today we can make a group video call for free! And recently with the lockdown pressured by the COVID-19 pandemic, even schools and work matters are conducted online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/21/05/21005195/making-sense-of-nft-mania" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;may also speed up&lt;/a&gt; the growth of another technology, &lt;b&gt;NFT&lt;/b&gt;. The technology was already introduced in 2017 with the appearance of &lt;a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt;, collectible digital drawings of cute cats, and &lt;a href="https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;CryptoPunks&lt;/a&gt;, similar digital characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in early March 2021, the hype peaked when &lt;b&gt;MetaKovan&lt;/b&gt; bought an NFT featuring a collage of 5000 artworks by &lt;b&gt;Beeple&lt;/b&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLEgrp-3P4I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;69.3 million&lt;/a&gt; US Dollars. It doesn’t end there. Last month, MetaKovan mentioned that he &lt;a href="https://ceomorningbrief.theedgemalaysia.com/pdf/2021/20210420_CMB_0171/b8y0th.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hired architects to build digital galleries&lt;/a&gt; to display his NFT collections, a gallery anyone can enter through web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, he visions building a whole digital universe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the hype exploded, the owners are free to sell the unique characters up to 4.2K ETH (Ethereum, equivalent to 7.57 million USD) per CryptoPunks’ character!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="content" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="what-nft" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is NFT again?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84798 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/What-is-NFT_.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;They also immediately feel like being a digital artist after reading the news. But before they start thinking about making or selling an &lt;b&gt;NFT&lt;/b&gt;, they should at least know what &lt;b&gt;NFT&lt;/b&gt; is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFT stands for &lt;b&gt;Non-Fungible Tokens&lt;/b&gt;. A token is just like a certificate of ownership, while non-fungible means non-imitable and unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will give them a simple example. A ball of a football game is fungible, as it can be easily reproduced in a factory. However, a ball signed by Christiano Ronaldo with a mention a name is non-fungible. Even if he signed 2 balls with the same content, the two balls are individually unique and will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, simply said, a &lt;b&gt;non-fungible token&lt;/b&gt; is an ownership certificate of a non-fungible item, but it’s not just that. The certificate is digitally recorded in the &lt;b&gt;blockchain&lt;/b&gt;. This doesn’t only mean that it will never be lost or damaged, it is also (almost) impossible to be hacked, stolen, or faked! Plus, everyone can easily verify the ownership by simply accessing the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, what is &lt;b&gt;blockchain&lt;/b&gt;? Well simply put, it’s a hack-proof, transparent, and decentralized technology to effectively and securely record transactions, just like an encrypted digital ledger book. But if you want to get into details, you can go &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/why-you-should-care-about-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to NFT… A lot of things can be made into NFT, but mostly are digital artworks such as digital paintings, edited videos, and photoshopped camera shots. They can even take a picture of a physical item and sell it off as an NFT, up to their creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_0_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="sell-NFT" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How can I Sell or Buy NFT?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84795 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/How-to-Sell-or-Buy-NFT_.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s quite simple. First, they need to find a digital marketplace that they can list your NFT in, then they need to have a crypto wallet, and lastly, they need to ‘mint’ their NFT, before registering it at the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Finding an NFT Marketplace&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NFT marketplace is somewhat similar to e-commerce sites such as Amazon. It basically lists out NFTs with either a fixed price or with a base price that’s open for bidding. Some marketplace sells a specific type of NFT, like how &lt;a href="https://nbatopshot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NBA Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; sells only their original video clips of NBA’s live basketball games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some are more famous than others, some use different crypto than Ethereum. So, in making their choice, they have to be sure of their preference, art category, and target market. In other words, they have to do their research very carefully. Good thing they have the internet to help them with that!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Creating a Crypto Wallet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After they decided on their preferred NFT Marketplace, they need to own some amount of cryptocurrency that is used by the marketplace. If they don’t have it yet, they can create a cryptocurrency wallet and convert their money into the targeted cryptocurrency. For example, if the marketplace uses &lt;a href="https://nem.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;XEM&lt;/a&gt;, they can convert their USD to XEM, or it is also common to say they have to &lt;i&gt;buy &lt;/i&gt;XEM using USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, Ethereum will be the top choice because it is the pioneer cryptocurrency that supports NFT. Plus, it is currently the most popular one worldwide after Bitcoin. Wait, what if they already have Bitcoins? sorry to inform, Bitcoin does not support NFT. However, they can use bitcoin to convert it to Ethereum, or any other cryptocurrencies that support NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Minting the NFT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, they need to hook their non-fungible item to the cryptocurrency. This process is called ‘minting’ whereby they digitally register on blockchain the non-fungible file together with related details, such as suggested price, or the story behind the art. Some marketplace offers the service to mint NFT. So yeah, make their choice wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then once the minting process is done, register the NFT to their preferred marketplace and their NFT is up for sale!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The buying process is quite similar, it’s just that instead of minting their original art, they register their name as the latest owner of the NFT after a successful purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_1_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NFT-catch" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What’s the catch?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84794 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Whats-the-Catch_.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can’t be that easy, right? Or else everyone who creates an NFT will already be rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;indeed&lt;/i&gt; easy to create and start listing your NFT. &lt;b&gt;BUT…&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. It is not cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time this article is written, 1 ETH (Etherium) is equivalent to 3,905.52 US Dollars. Usually, the minting process itself will charge a few percentages of ETH. So, before they even start minting, they need to already have a lot of cryptocurrencies! Not to mention that when they manage to sell their art or buy another, another small percentage (typically 0.25%, which is about 9.76 USD) will be charged by the marketplace. Well, they also need to make a living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. It is not fully decentralized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although NFT itself is decentralized, they need a marketplace to list their NFT, which means that they have to agree with the rules set by the marketplace. Every marketplace may have specific rules. Some marketplace doesn’t authenticate the originality of an asset before it is minted. So, there’s a small risk that someone can steal their art and mint it as theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. It does not guarantee money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, NFTs are sold as actions, whereby people offer or ‘bid’ their prices to an NFT. The highest bidder gets to buy the NFT. That being said, if nobody wants to bid for their artwork, then they won’t get the cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NFT-catch" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Really, then how come there are NFT worth millions of USD?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, FYI most expensive NFTs sold are originally owned by famous or influential people. If they got a fanbase, most likely their fans would want to own things associated with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s also the reason that some experts thought of NFT as a mere hype bubble that will explode anytime soon. People who are too excited or &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/fomo-fear-of-missing-out-vs-fmf-first-mover-fear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;fear of missing out&lt;/a&gt; may join the frenzy recklessly without enough knowledge, and it’s only a matter of time that they realize to have invested time and expensive cryptocurrencies for something with a vague future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_2_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NFT-hoax" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_6 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NFT is a Hoax?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84796 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Is-NFT-a-Hoax__.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NFT is very good. Especially in this digital era whereby people spent months creating an outstanding digital artwork – only for other people to download it and used it for themselves without permission or paying any royalties to the artist. When anybody on the internet can do that, then why would anyone pay a high amount of money for it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A work of art takes a lot of work and time, and the artists have to make a living to feed themselves and their families. By selling their arts as NFT, anyone can easily trace the ownership of an artwork, making counterfeit or fraud attempts useless while acknowledging the artist’s talent. In fact, some NFTs pay a percentage of royalties to the original artists each time the artwork is resold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, to create an NFT out of physical items, or their physical collectible items, for example, is totally not worth the price. Especially when they&amp;#8217;re not a well-known person yet, or simply have so much better things to spend their money on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_3_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NFT-alt" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_7 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;NFT Alternative?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84797 aligncenter size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/NFT-Alternative__.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are more cost-effective ways to authenticate, track, trace, and verify ownership of physical items by simply applying the basic decentralized and unique features of blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/our-products/papyrus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Papyrus by LuxTag&lt;/a&gt; allows any artists, collectors, craftsmen, and in fact, anyone can tokenize their assets into blockchain to record the items’ stories and a trail of ownership with extremely low cost. There are other similar solutions out there, but unfortunately not many talk about them or even know them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…&lt;em&gt;in a very large number of cases, NFT is a completely unnecessary tool&lt;/em&gt;,” commented Alex, who is among the people mentioned in the first block of SYMBOL Blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;For example, when transferring ownership of a physical art object, in my opinion, LuxTag handles it best. Papyrus implements the association principle of transferring unique rights through a normal address-to-address transaction&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;If something can be solved sparingly, solve it sparingly&lt;/em&gt;,”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can they get rich by selling NFT? If they got the talent and capital, they should go ahead and test the market. It’s just that there’s no guarantee that they will get a high return. Maybe it’ll work out, maybe it won’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, if they&amp;#8217;re already a collector looking for a solution to track &amp;#38; trace their assets, they can try &lt;b&gt;Papyrus&lt;/b&gt;. For the first time registration will be getting a free XEM so that anyone can immediately start registering their assets for free! Try it out &lt;a href="https://papyrus.luxtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s business world, blockchain is becoming a fundamental tool that your business can use to secure your products. Blockchain’s position in businesses is just like a laptop compared to a paper. Both laptop and paper can be used for documentation, but the laptop is faster, more secure, more convenient, more accessible, and allows room for better collaboration. However, blockchain is one step ahead, it’s not owned or governed by any specific person. It is decentralized!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is a type of &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledgers.asp#:~:text=Underlying%20distributed%20ledgers%20is%20the,distributed%20ledger%20used%20by%20bitcoin." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;distributed ledger&lt;/a&gt; that records transactions between two parties securely without any intermediaries. When a transaction is executed, the record of the transaction is sent to everyone in the network, allowing the database to exist across multiple locations and multiple participants. In other words, it is a decentralized, self-maintained, fast, affordable, and transparent recording system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain can record anything, it could be a tangible asset such as a house, cash, car, and it could also be intangible, such as a painting or a tweet! If they have heard about &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nft-nonfungible-token-blockchain-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NFT&lt;/a&gt; that allows a person to sell the ownership of his or her arts, just for their info, it uses blockchain. Basically, anything that has value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/why-you-should-care-about-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; explained blockchain in layman terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blockchain for Business &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84722 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Finance_Blockchain_364306.jpeg?resize=1080%2C608&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="691" height="389" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Image source: inc.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementing blockchain in their business means allowing your team members or clients to record or view the same information, which leads to efficiency, trust-building, and less friction between each other. Blockchain delivers these benefits based on these four attributes unique to the technology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consensus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shared ledgers are updated only after the transaction is cryptographically validated by all relevant participants involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an event is recorded, copies of the records are automatically created for the participants in the channel. Every single partner shares and sees the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immutability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the blockchain, more blocks can be added but once added, they cannot be removed. Hence, there’s a permanent record of every transaction which attracts trust from team members and stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Security&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a private blockchain, only the authorized entities have access and are allowed to create blocks. That being said, random people won’t be able to create and access the blocks as they like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;How blockchain can boost their business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain technology has evolved rapidly since the introduction of bitcoin.  A business can take advantage of blockchain through &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/the-crucial-problem-of-inheritance-frauds/?utm_source=linkedin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;smart contracts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;Originally introduced in 1993, a smart contract is a code stored on a blockchain that works when predetermined conditions are met and verified. Besides, smart contracts too can automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies that use blockchain for their business and smart contracts is the gigantic IBM. IBM has been using blockchain which is based on Hyperledger Fabric version 1.0 from the Linux Foundation.&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/19/ibm-unveils-blockchain-as-a-service-based-on-open-source-hyperledger-fabric-technology/#:~:text=IBM%20unveiled%20its%20%E2%80%9CBlockchain%20as,to%20build%20secure%20blockchain%20networks.&amp;#38;text=At%20its%20core%20blockchain%20is,and%20tamper%2Dproof%20digital%20ledger." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt; IBM’s&lt;/a&gt; blockchain is a public cloud that customers can use to build their blockchain network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from smart contracts, blockchain can &lt;b&gt;enhance security, &lt;/b&gt;especially for sensitive and crucial data. Not only records created can’t be altered or changed, but it is also encrypted from end-to-end. This feature made blockchain one of the main tools to prevent fraud and unauthorized activity. It makes it hard for hackers to alter data since information is stored across a network of computers rather than a single server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, &lt;b&gt;greater transparency&lt;/b&gt; is one of the ways blockchain can benefit your business. Since blockchain is using a distributed ledger, transactions and data recorded are identical in multiple locations. All network participants who want to access this will see the same information at the same time, which provides full transparency. All the data and transactions are immutably recorded and time and date stamped. They can be assured that there’s no internal traitor making unauthorized transactions behind their back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, blockchain gives &lt;b&gt;instant traceability&lt;/b&gt;. Blockchain creates an audit trail that documents the provenance of an asset at every step of its journey. In industries where consumers are concerned about human rights issues surrounding a product, or worried about counterfeiting and fraud, this trail helps to provide the proof. Learn how blockchain help in tracking and tracing your products &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/track-trace-all-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blockchain and LuxTag? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, blockchain is indeed a need in their business as it brings a lot of benefits in terms of smart contracts, security, transparency, and traceability. Implementing a blockchain system in their business would also secure their products from being counterfeited and help them in gaining the trust of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LuxTag implemented a blockchain system that enables their products to prove their brand’s authenticity, and protect it from counterfeit. &lt;b&gt;BrandTag a SaaS solution&lt;/b&gt; allows each of their products to get a unique identity that can be verified no matter where the product is being sold. It helps their customers to verify the authenticity of their product, know about their product history, and be updated with the latest promotions.

NEM Symbol is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain with an innovative tokenomics model that democratizes access to rewards for securing the network. The tokenomics model was accepted by the community in a binding on-chain vote, and part of that model includes a Supernode program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program could not be launched with the main chain launch, and work has been ongoing since launch to get it ready. That work is now nearing completion, and we have now released it for broader community involvement and testing on Testnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="supernode-testing-open-call"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernode testing open call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NEM Symbol Supernode Program is almost ready. After solving some issues, it has been tested in both the development and public Testnet environments. Alpha testing has passed — now it needs the community to help make sure that everything runs as it should in the varied environments of the real world!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encourage all NEM community members who will be running nodes to enroll in the program on Testnet for a couple of weeks to complete more exhaustive testing and plan a launch date for Mainnet. We are making an open call for organizations and individuals to collaborate in this endeavor because the better the number and mix of testing scenarios/environments/setups involved with testing the nodes, the better the results will be for the program which will run on Mainnet for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you like to know more about participating in our &lt;a href="https://forum.nem.io/t/symbol-supernode-programme-community-testing/30081"&gt;open call for NEM Symbol Supernode community testing? Click here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="what-are-nem-symbol-supernodes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are NEM Symbol Supernodes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the NEM Symbol launch, our community has been keen to get knee-deep into keeping the network up by &lt;a href="https://docs.symbolplatform.com/guides/network/supernode-enrollment.html"&gt;enrolling in the Supernode Program&lt;/a&gt; and running their own. It’s a great way to help support the NEM Symbol blockchain while earning rewards by staking XYM and validating blocks. They work similarly to NEM NIS1 Supernodes for those familiar with the program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEM Symbol nodes contain multiple deployment options. All nodes that participated in the consensus mechanism are considered equal. NEM Symbol Nodes can have one or more of the following roles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peer: produces and validates blocks (sometimes called a validator on other chains)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;API: a data access layer to make integration with the peer node simpler&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dual: Peer and API running on the same node&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Voting: Eligible and enrolled to participate in the finality solution, a Grandpa gadget based solution, has min 3m XYM staked on it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SuperNode: Dual node passing minimum performance, stake, and uptime tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it is true that all peer nodes are equal in the network, participation in the Voting process is reserved for nodes that are of a sufficiently large stake size to be significant in securing the network — they act together in a PBFT manner to decide which blocks should be marked final and which should not. An additional network reward is set aside by the protocol to reward this extra role, and it equals 5% of each finalized block’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Supernode is not assigned any special status in the protocol or consensus mechanisms; it is a layer two solution that rewards node owners who run nodes considered to be akin to exceptional network citizens. The nodes meet minimum performance, uptime, version, and stake conditions; this is tested multiple times every day. They provide a consistent and reliable backbone to the network and are incentivized to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href="https://docs.symbolplatform.com/concepts/reward-programs.html#requirements"&gt;requirements for creating a Supernode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NEM Symbol Supernode Program adds additional incentive to help ensure that the network has enough reliable and resilient nodes to remain secure, stable, and performant. It does this through a layer 2 Rewards Program administered by NEM Group. The rewards are paid in the form of XYM tokens once per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="incentives-and-rewards"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incentives and rewards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As agreed in the community-approved Tokenomics model, the NEM Symbol Supernode reward program will last six years after the NEM Symbol launch, and rewards decrease gradually over that time. Supernodes are divided into tiers depending on the XYM amount staked, with the daily rewards split among them. This incentive program runs parallel with the regular block rewards (Fees and Inflation) that nodes obtain for producing blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three tiers are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1m XYM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2m XYM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3m XYM&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a non-linear increase as a node moves up through the tiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More information on the NEM &lt;a href="https://docs.symbolplatform.com/concepts/reward-programs.html#rewards"&gt;Symbol Supernode program rewards here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEM empowers decentralization by incentivizing community members to get involved in technological development. By following some technical steps, any NEMber can get their node up and running, start validating blocks and collect fantastic rewards in XYM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get involved today and help us achieve a truly decentralized future!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;img src="https://blog.nem.io/content/images/2021/05/Symbol-Wallet-on-Vidulum.png" alt="The Symbol Wallet is Now Available on Vidulum App"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, many innovative blockchain projects aim to strengthen the blockchain ecosystem, drive mass adoption, and close knowledge gaps. Symbol from NEM, the trusted, secure value exchange network for business, has recently joined forces with Vidulum, the non-custodial multi-coin web wallet, to prove their commitment to this goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vidulum App has endorsed NEM’s Symbol (XYM) since its recent launch on  March 17th. Since the launch of the mainnet, Viddulum and Symbol users can earn V-Staking incentives in VDL for staking XYM on their wallets, along with other advantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep reading for all the details about Vidulum and NEM Group’s ongoing collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symbol Wallet on Vidulum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://vidulum.app/symbol-wallet.html" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vidulum Symbol Wallet&lt;/a&gt; enables people to participate in digital asset markets by accessing and storing cryptocurrencies efficiently while remaining in control of their private access information. With the Vidulum app, users have complete control of their private keys, allowing them to send, receive, and manage their Symbol tokens through web browsers or the android &amp;#38; IOS apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XYM live on Vidulum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;XYM is the native currency of the Symbol blockchain. After supporting the Symbol snapshot, XYM tokens are live on the Vidulum app, allowing users to store, send, and receive their XYM through this non-custodial platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V-Staking XYM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;XYM holders can also earn rewards in VDL (Vidulum native token) by staking the Symbol token on the Vidulum &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; wallet. The&lt;a href="https://vidulum.app/blog/2020/07/15/What-Is-V-Staking-How-To-Earn-VDL/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;V-Staking program&lt;/a&gt; by Vidulum is an excellent way for users to earn extra VDL tokens, in addition to running a masternode or mining VDL from the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To V-stake VDLs, users first need to create an account on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Vidulum &lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, hold a minimum of 100 XYMs, and make sure they log in at least once every 60 days. The V-staking rewards system distributes 100 VDLs every day, and the earned amount will always depend on the staked amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Example: &lt;em&gt;100 VDL daily distribution for XYM. The total V-Staking pool is 10000 units; a coin holder has 1000 units, they will receive 10% of the daily distribution (10 VDL).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to know more about how the Symbol – Viddulum integration can help you access your crypto assets easily, drop us a &lt;a href="https://nem.io/contact/" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;line.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;With the rise of cryptocurrency and the advancement of technology, they may start to come across the term “blockchain” more frequently. However, if they’re not from the IT industry, most likely they’ll be wondering what blockchain really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are interested to know about blockchain, but not fond of the technological jargon or information, then keep reading! Don’t worry because this article describes in layman terms the application and relevance of blockchain in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if they’re looking for the latest and detailed technical description of blockchain, they can go &lt;a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/crypto/tutorials/what-is-blockchain#what-is-blockchain-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;

&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Should I Care About Blockchain?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84692 aligncenter size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Should-I-care-blockchain.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;The first time they heard about blockchain, they associated it with bitcoin. They personally have no interest in forex trading and using bitcoin, so it might be irrelevant to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They started to learn that bitcoin and blockchain are separate matters. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, while blockchain is the technology behind it. 00However, the two are often associated with each other because bitcoin was the first practical application of blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blockchain is actually a system whereby any two people in the blockchain network can make any transaction with conditions agreed by both parties – without any intermediaries! The transaction can then be verified, confirmed, and viewed by anyone in the same network – also without any intermediaries!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This system allows extensive applications and benefits, including decentralization, transparency, and privacy. LuxTag, for example, used blockchain technology to counter frauds and counterfeits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, understanding this system, Bitcoin is actually the simplest application of blockchain. Currently, there are many other cryptocurrency platforms with more advanced protocols, such as &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Etherium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/040515/what-litecoin-and-how-does-it-work.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Litecoin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/meet-nem-xem-harvested-cryptocurrency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NEM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, blockchain is not limited to the financial sector only. The application of blockchain in other sectors is currently blooming, and its potential is boundless. Recently, a Singaporean Firm, TADA, applied blockchain technology in its no-commission ride-hailing service, &lt;a href="https://vulcanpost.com/743636/tada-ride-hailing-blockchain-model-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;resulting in lower charges borne by the users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get back to the question again: should you care about blockchain? The answer is definitely &lt;b&gt;YES&lt;/b&gt;. Blockchain is the future, especially in this global era whereby there&amp;#8217;s no longer bound by geographical borders. One day, they might be riding a car that uses blockchain technology, so it’s totally worth knowing to understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is so Special About Blockchain?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84695 aligncenter size-large" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blockchain-so-special.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;The most special thing about blockchain is that it uses cryptography to verify every transaction. Cryptography is like a very, very difficult mathematical puzzle that can only be solved with the help of computers. In fact, the puzzle is so hard that the computer must be very, very powerful and consumed a lot of electricity. However, most often the one who managed to verify the transaction gets rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one who verifies a Bitcoin transaction, for example, is rewarded with Bitcoin itself. This is the thing that keeps the blockchain network alive and growing. Then, after verification, the record of the transaction will be sent to everyone in the network, enabling transparency and security. Let’s get into details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Decentralized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main concept of decentralization in blockchain technology is that the ownership does not fall onto a single authority and that there is no intermediary. When they want to give money to person A, they can give the money directly and immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, being decentralized promotes fairness. Basically, as long as they have internet access, they can view, make, and if they have the computer powerful enough, they can even verify transactions in the blockchain. This is regardless of their nationality, religion, and social status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, of course, they need some tools such as cryptocurrency wallets or applications that use blockchain to really implement it. &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;LuxTag&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/our-products/papyrus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Papyrus&lt;/a&gt; are some examples of platforms to make blockchain transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different from making a transaction through intermediaries such as a bank. They have to pass the money to the bank and trust it to pay person A the correct amount of money. There are many issues arising from this conventional method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, there’s no such thing as free lunch, so they may have to give some commission to the intermediaries to do the job right. Next, we don’t really know what they do with our money before it gets to person A. Then, what if the intermediaries get robbed along the way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And ultimately, relying on intermediaries means they let them know so much personal information about us, like the amount of money they have and who are they giving the money to. Who knows if they want to manipulate the information, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many issues, all related to trust. This is the problem that blockchain solved, which leads to the next specialties of blockchain: privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Private &amp;#38; confidential&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main idea behind Satoshi Nakamoto’s invention of Bitcoin was to make online monetary transactions without the bank knowing how much money that he had or the purpose of his transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With blockchain, nobody can know your job or monthly income from your transactions, thanks to its so-called “pseudonymity”. Unless they share the information personally, that is. Pseudonymity means that they don’t need to register a blockchain address as belonging to them. They just create it as a random string of digits and they can start using it. They don’t even have to fill up their name!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only things people can see are the transaction details (such as time, date, &amp;#38; amount) and the blockchain address (like an email address). The details can be a lot more, depending on the blockchain platforms they’re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Secure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the blockchain, every transaction must be digitally signed by both parties who made the transaction. Once the transaction is confirmed, everyone in the network keeps a record of every transaction, and once a transaction is recorded, nobody can change it, while everyone can verify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If someone wants to hack the system, he or she has to change every single transaction record available before the system notices. So, it is roughly impossible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transparency of the recorded transactions also protects the community members from fraud and corruption. Since everyone can see the records, it’ll be hard to conduct corruption without being noticed! Plus, they save the risk of private information leaks, because there’s no need to share them in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_1_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="how-blockchain-work" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How Does Blockchain Work?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84696 aligncenter size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/How-blockchain-works.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now after getting hyped on what blockchain can do, they may wonder how it functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, honestly, the main thing it does is recording transactions, just like a ledger book. However, instead of writing the transactions onto pages, they were recorded in blocks. Each block can only fit a limited number of transactions, just like pages does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, usually dedicate ledger pages to specific dates, right? Similarly, a block may only be used within a limited time or conditions, depending on different blockchains. When that time ran out, another block will be added, chained to the previous blocks in sequential orders. Similar to how pages of a book bound to each other!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can they see the pattern now? However, unlike the physical ledger book, blockchain is available online whereby everyone in the network can see and contribute to the transactions, and the number of blocks that can be added is infinite!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the biggest difference of blockchain ledger compared to any record tracking application is every transaction will only be recorded once it is verified through cryptography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, it’s basically a technology that digitally and securely records transactions like a ledger book. They can decide to record a variety of things: such as contracts, vehicle movements, or anything they can think of!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_2_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="brandtag" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Using Blockchain to Fight Counterfeit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-84694 aligncenter size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/blockchain-fight-counterfeit.png?resize=1024%2C411&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="411" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counterfeit has been sucking the life from innovation, creativity, and novelty. Seeing blockchain as a solution for this crisis, LuxTag participated in blockchain awareness programs. Recently, LuxTag conducted a &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/luxtag-organized-an-international-webinar-on-product-citizenship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;webinar&lt;/a&gt; whereby they encouraged smart packaging and demonstrated methods to DIY it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LuxTag is also providing anti-counterfeit solutions such as &lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;BrandTag&lt;/a&gt; by using the &lt;a href="https://nem.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NEM &amp;#38; SYMBOL blockchain&lt;/a&gt;, in the efforts to help products against the threat of counterfeit. BrandTag also goes beyond tackling counterfeit – it enables enhanced consumer engagement and provides data insights to brand owners through its smart packaging concept. With BrandTag, both brand owners and consumers can benefit from blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;LuxTag had successfully conducted its first webinar on Product Citizenship: Empower Your Product to Protect and Promote Your Business on the 21st of April 2021. Rene Bernard and Jeff McDonald, both co-founders of LuxTag were the speakers, moderated by Imane Mourassilo, LuxTag’s Marketing Executive.The free webinar attracted registrants mainly from Malaysia and Indonesia, while also welcoming those coming from India, Thailand, California, United States, Egypt, United Kingdom, Venezuela, Morocco, Russia, and Italy, which may be stimulated by the international nature of LuxTag members and connections ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main highlight of the webinar was smart packaging, which is the heart of product citizenship. Jeff took the part to explain how smart product packaging was developed with the aid of QR codes, NFC tags, and ultimately, blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84556" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Jeff-describing-the-evolution-of-product-packaging.png?resize=820%2C312&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="691" height="263" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jeff describing the evolution of product packaging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rene proceeded with the second highlight of the webinar, a demonstration on the self-implementation of smart packaging. For demo purposes, he suggested web applications that were either free or provided a free-trial period to generate engaging, attractive, and trackable QR codes. He also pointed out careful considerations to take note of while generating DIY QR codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84561" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Rene-presenting-the-resulted-QR-code-generated-from-the-demonstrated-tool.png?resize=820%2C312&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="691" height="263" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rene presenting a QR code that was generated with the demonstrated tools&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although DIY smart packaging is doable, doing it for a large batch of products is not very practical. So, Rene announced the soft launch of LuxTag’s flagship SaaS, &lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;BrandTag&lt;/a&gt; which can save all the DIY hustle, and invited the attendees to sign up for &lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/book-a-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;BrandTag’s one-month free trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imane opened up a Q&amp;#38;A session at the end of the webinar and the speakers entertained all curious questions from the attendees. Before waving goodbye, Imane hinted that LuxTag will be conducting more webinars in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you missed the webinar, you can watch it &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mIyG4SRuyc&amp;#38;t=134s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and stay tuned for upcoming webinars to gain exclusive privileges as attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The supply chain is a melange of processes that go through many stages before the final step, for instance, shipping out the products to the end-user. The supply chain includes all the activities, organizations,&amp;#46;&amp;#46;&amp;#46;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io/track-trace/"&gt;Track and Trace: All You Need To Know&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io"&gt;NEM News Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The supply chain is a melange of processes that go through many stages before the final step, for instance, shipping out the products to the end-user. The supply chain includes all the activities, organizations, information, and requirements of resources to move a product (ship) to a customer. For instance, raw materials, production, packaging, shipping, warehousing, delivering, and retailing. Alongside that, the supply chain supplies millions of consumers and businesses all around the world. Some companies have already developed supply chains in their businesses so they can reduce their costs and remain competitive in the business landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the supply chain, there is a system called “Track &amp;#38; Trace” which manufacturers use as a tool to identify the past and present locations of all the product inventory, as well as the product history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track &amp;#38; Trace requires knowing the product’s journey from scratch, through various geographic regions for processing and manufacturing, regulative control, and towards the end of the process, which is to reach retailers and customers. Tracking the product’s origin throughout this process is far-reaching to ensure the product’s authenticity. Above all, track &amp;#38; trace have notable benefits that manage to help most companies deliver goods in no time, below are the detailed explanations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Benefits of Track &amp;#38; Trace &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84485 size-full" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/supply-chain.jpeg?resize=1024%2C579&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1024" height="579" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Image source&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;: Techsling&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the idea of track and trace isn’t simple, creating an effective system offers numerous benefits that are worth the effort. Here are five of the most important benefits of effective track &amp;#38; trace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Real-time track and trace solution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system uses handheld devices merged with an online facility to capture tracking information in real-time. This helps both customers and businesses to have the ability to track and trace the product journey from raw material, identify the past and current location, and product history. As a result, customers now have instant access to the status of their deliveries. Tracking the product’s journey could confirm the product’s authenticity. &lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Full access to delivery status via the online interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full access to delivery status via an online interface is similar to real-time track &amp;#38; trace. Full access to delivery gives customers peace of mind by letting the customers have control over the shipments of the product by helping them stay informed about the product’s whereabouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data availability within 5 minutes of delivery or shipment &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other &lt;b&gt;benefit&lt;/b&gt; of track and trace is that the data will be available within 5 minutes of delivery of the shipment. This will make the customers feel more convenient and secured with track and trace. All the sensors will start their own system that lets the data be available as soon as the shipment is out for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drastic reduction in workload for customer support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track &amp;#38; Trace has given many benefits to the supply chain. Once the track &amp;#38; trace system has been implemented, there will be a drastic reduction in workload for customer support since the track and trace system will do the work for them. Hence, it could lessen the workload for the customer support since all the information the customer needs can be found by track and trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Paperless, mobile data transmissions via handheld devices&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track &amp;#38; trace is contributing to nature too! It is made paperless so it would be effective for customers to detect their product shipping information since it requires mobile data transmissions that use the radio spectrum to &lt;b&gt;transmit&lt;/b&gt; signals through the atmosphere. It may carry analog or digital signals and can be used on LANs or WANs in one- or two-way networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;Track and trace: Improving the visibility of supply chain &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84483 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1_4gG9Orf53v4_QHJJsXNpfQ.jpeg?resize=1080%2C540&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="540" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a fundamental exercise, track and trace help companies more effectively manage on-time delivery performance, control freight costs, meet regulatory requirements, and deliver higher levels of customer service. Consumers demand real-time visibility, along with the near-immediate delivery of goods. This has created a great deal of supply chain disruption, causing businesses to reevaluate the way they operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track and trace concept is supported through a variety of technologies to assist in providing real-time information on the location and status of these specified items throughout the supply chain which is more critical than ever due to the increasing levels of governmental regulations. To improve the visibility of the supply chain, there are three main tips that businesses should follow on how to achieve end-to-end visibility, and ultimately ensure a&lt;b&gt; more efficient supply chain. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every business should &lt;a href="https://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/increasing-supply-chain-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;start with building the experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You should start by defining what visibility means to your end-users, on what kinds of experience you want them to have; is it a satisfying experience or a bad one, it all depends on how you portray it and what you want to gain from increased visibility.  On the other hand, businesses should &lt;a href="https://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/increasing-supply-chain-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;focus on real-time transparency. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The data exchange of frequency and size is dramatically increasing at an accelerated rate that if businesses can process the data in real-time, it is vital. Above all, every digital platform that a business holds should connect well with potential customers/existing customers. A successful business should &lt;a href="https://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/increasing-supply-chain-visibility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;select a platform for connectivity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that would ensure the platform is technologically cynical and all potential customers can have access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;BrandTag as one of the solutions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-84412" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brandtag-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="567" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The potential for blockchain applications in healthcare is enormous. Paper files, data breaches, and inaccessible medical records have no room in the global, hyperconnected world we live in. Decentralization can be a strong ally in transforming a critical sector such as health, especially in the post-pandemic world we’re in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;img src="https://blog.nem.io/content/images/2021/04/symbol-dhealth.png" alt="dHealth Network built on Symbol aims to empower e-health"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The potential for blockchain applications in healthcare is enormous. Paper files, data breaches, and inaccessible medical records have no room in the global, hyperconnected world we live in. Decentralization can be a strong ally in transforming a critical sector such as health, especially in the post-pandemic world we’re in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blockchain distributed ledgers can increase security, transparency, and trust while providing patients with greater control over their medical data and helping professionals develop new treatments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s why witnessing the &lt;a href="https://dhealth.network/2021/03/02/network-launch/"&gt;launch of dHealth&lt;/a&gt; – the Symbol-powered healthcare-specialized blockchain network – is so special to us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-dhealth-symbol-partnership"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The dHealth / Symbol partnership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dhealth.network/"&gt;DHealth Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (formerly HIT Foundation) is a Swiss not-for-profit foundation aiming to empower healthcare data-sharing and make medical records accessible while keeping them secure, transparent, and immutable. DHealth is also the name of its public blockchain network built on &lt;a href="https://symbolplatform.com/"&gt;Symbol&lt;/a&gt;, NEM’s recently launched new blockchain. DHealth benefits considerably from the built-in features that are core to Symbol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to health-related data is vital for the development of new cures. As such, dHealth has the mission of nurturing a decentralized healthcare data ecosystem. Symbol’s cutting-edge technical features enable scalability and openness, allowing dHealth to become a trustworthy backend to connect patients and healthcare providers. But this partnership intends to go even further than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-decentralized-healthcare-ecosystem"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The decentralized healthcare ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DHealth encompasses a total rethink of approaching the healthcare data exchange by providing a decentralized, transparent, and easy-to-access data system to all healthcare stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By incentivizing patients to use their health data, professionals worldwide can use this valuable information to improve their care. Blockchain infrastructure provides end-users extra trust regarding the privacy of their medical records. DHealth native token also constitutes an additional incentive for people to collaborate in medical research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DHealth has developed an open&lt;a href="https://dhealth.network/2021/01/11/health-certificates-on-blockchain/"&gt;health certificate&lt;/a&gt; to register tests or vaccinations on the blockchain that can be verified independently. By tracking vaccines, health authorities can deploy health plans more efficiently, especially in a post-COVID19 scenario. And, as we know, holding health certificates protects the most vulnerable population at any given time. Tracking and tracing all kinds of medical certificates and registries provides an immutable, secure, and globally accessible healthcare ledger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The healthcare industry can use the dHealth Network as infrastructure for various use cases, including protecting supply chain processes and streamlining payment processes. Having access to tried-and-true infrastructure will help jumpstart innovation without diverting valuable resources away from other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="would-you-like-to-learn-more-about-dhealth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you like to learn more about dHealth?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please visit the &lt;a href="https://dhealth.network/"&gt;dHealth&lt;/a&gt; website to explore this healthcare-specialized blockchain’s potential benefits for both healthcare professionals and companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="references"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dhealth.network/2021/03/02/network-launch/"&gt;https://dhealth.network/2021/03/02/network-launch/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dhealth.network/docs/Whitepaper-dHealth-Network.pdf"&gt;https://dhealth.network/docs/Whitepaper-dHealth-Network.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <content:encoded>&lt;img src="https://blog.nem.io/content/images/2021/04/Symbol-launch-highlight-coverage-blog.png" alt="Symbol in the Media: Public Launch and What’s Next!"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last week, NEM made headlines with the highly anticipated launch of &lt;a href="http://symbolplatform.com/"&gt;Symbol&lt;/a&gt;. After four years of building, testing and collaboration among the Core Developers, NEM community, supporting entities and partners, the Symbol Proof-of-Stake+ public blockchain is live!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To mark the occasion, multiple spokespeople in the NEM ecosystem spoke to members of the media, discussing Symbol’s technical features, use cases and the platform’s potential in building the new economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/"&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/a&gt;, a giant in the blockchain media space, spoke to Kristy-Leigh Minehan, CTO of NEM Software, and published an article about the launch. See the &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/nem-proof-of-stake-enterprise-facing-blockchain-platform"&gt;full article here&lt;/a&gt; (Japanese language version &lt;a href="https://www.coindeskjapan.com/102521/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We believe we are going to see a lot of flexibility in how people use these private and public networks together. You can think of your private network as something of a staging area and platform for public networks. We’re excited to see what comes out of that,”&lt;/em&gt;– Kristy-Leigh Minehan&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong-based news outlet &lt;a href="https://forkast.news/"&gt;Forkast.News&lt;/a&gt; spoke to David Mansell, NEM Group’s COO who heads up NEM Group’s growth strategy in APAC, about a number of initial use cases, including the &lt;a href="https://wavegp.com/funds/wave-kentucky-whiskey/"&gt;Kentucky Whiskey Digital Fund&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.lb.lt/en/digital-collector-coin-lbcoin"&gt;LBCOIN&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href="https://forkast.news/nem-launch-new-symbol-blockchain-xym/"&gt;full article here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We’re looking to encourage interoperability and collaboration with the other blockchains. We’re not competing against them. We want Symbol to be known as the chain to underpin what we call the new economy — using technology to create a fairer society that is more inclusive and accessible.”&lt;/em&gt;– David Mansell&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reach of the news was truly global, with coverage published across 70+ media outlets in &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.co.jp/news/detail/20210316-00122521-coindesk-bus_all"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.btc-echo.de/nem-macht-sich-bereit-fuer-airdrop-und-security-token-15032021/"&gt;Germany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.koreaittimes.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=104429"&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/brand-post/symbol-from-nem-the-next-generation-enterprise-grade-blockchain-platform-101615549847039.html"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://0xzx.com/2021031523481263570.html"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.haber.com/xym-coin-ne-zaman-dagitilacak-nem-group-nedir-symbol-xym-nedir-538872/"&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bits.media/nem-group-zapustila-platformu-symbol-posle-nebolshoy-zaderzhki/"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.khaleejtimes.com/business-and-technology-review/powering-possibility"&gt;The United Arab Emirates&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io/product-citizenshipgood-citizenbad-citizen/"&gt;Product Citizenship: Good Citizen, Bad Citizen&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io"&gt;NEM News Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_0 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, their arm starts to swell, and their temperature spikes to 40 degrees Celsius! They immediately report to their healthcare provider. Upon getting their report, they stop the endorsement of vaccines from the same batch and contact those who already got the shot to see if they have the same symptoms. It turns out that they have received reports of allergic reactions from 80% of people getting the shot of the batch as them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their initiative has helped the authorities to conclude that the vaccine they have received is a &lt;i&gt;bad product citizen&lt;/i&gt;. Meanwhile, the track and trace system embedded in the product packaging has helped the authorities to quickly trace the vaccines from the same batch and halt them from inflicting more damage. The system has saved the vaccine’s producer from experiencing major losses from having to recall all released vaccines to investigate the allergic reaction issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This&lt;b&gt; track and trace &lt;/b&gt;system is one of the components that drive Product Citizenship. Wait, what is Product Citizenship? Well, just like how their country has a system to ensure each of the citizens has a unique identification,&lt;b&gt; product citizenship ensures every product of a brand can be identified and be tracked&lt;/b&gt;. However, instead of having an identification card to verify one’s identity, a product’s identity is verified through smart packaging. QR code and NFC tagging are some examples of smart packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn more about product citizenship and smart packaging &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/product-citizenship-give-your-products-an-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What is Product Citizenship?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the human world, only those who are recognized as citizens can apply for an Identification Card (IC), so that the government can protect their welfare and respond to their needs accordingly. Of course, there are people without IC called illegal immigrants. The immigration department can seize them upon being discovered, and if they fail to provide relevant authentication documents the department may take legal actions, such as deportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same case goes for products. As a brand owner, it is crucial to ID tag your products so that you can ensure that your products achieve your brand’s standards and can be promoted more effectively. Products without a properly displayed ID can easily be questioned in terms of their authenticity, causing customers to lose confidence in purchasing the product. An immediate example to demonstrate this situation is Halal products that failed to display sufficient documentation; shoppers can question whether the products are really halal and thus are less likely to purchase them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like how there are good and bad human citizens, there will be good and bad product citizens. Good product citizens are the products that are produced according to compliances, such as still not passing the expiry dates, and safe to be consumed. Meanwhile, &lt;i&gt;bad product citizens &lt;/i&gt;can be those which are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;expired&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;tampered&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;problematic/ unsafe to be consumed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;failed to pass certification/compliance (example: Halal and/or others)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, thanks to the implementation of product citizenship through smart packaging, they can now notify the consumer whether the products are safe to use, or alert them whenever they become a &lt;i&gt;bad product citizen&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, real case studies were discussed to clarify the role of good citizens and bad citizens, and to demonstrate how product citizenship will benefit you with its three main features: Track &amp;#38; Trace, Authenticity Verification, and Customer Engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="content" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_1 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Who are the &lt;i&gt;bad product citizens&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="who-are-bad-citizen" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_2 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84409 size-full" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Article-1-Bad-citizen.png?resize=1080%2C608&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="608" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bad citizens &lt;/i&gt;can come from lots of different cases. However, it is enough to understand the concept of &lt;i&gt;bad citizens &lt;/i&gt;from these three popular culprits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faulty products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Counterfeited products, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Products attached to fake rumors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at them one by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Faulty Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covid-19 is an ongoing pandemic that drives people to be anxious, afraid, doubtful, and excited at the same time, especially regarding the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines produced by several companies globally, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moderna&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tx&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pfizer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;-BioNTech&lt;/b&gt; from the &lt;b&gt;United States&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;AstraZeneca&lt;/b&gt; from the United Kingdom, &lt;b&gt;Sinovac&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Cansino Biologics&lt;/b&gt; from China, and &lt;b&gt;Sputnick V&lt;/b&gt; from Russia, in which the choice of brands in a country depends on the endorsement of its governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laboratory researches for the vaccines were conducted in quite a haste in the effort to quickly flatten the curve of COVID-19 infection and death rate. At the same time, the vaccine producers compete with each other to gain the public’s preference. So, information on the effectiveness and safety of the vaccines is very limited, which means there are unknown risks of taking them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the companies heavily depend on the feedback and report of any adverse effects on people taking it to consistently preserve and promote their brand. An example is a case related to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-01-18/moderna-vaccine-allergic-reaction-california-batch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;a batch of Moderna vaccines in the US&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whereby the reported allergy cases from vaccine shots of a batch were higher than the average allergy cases per batch. Moderna quickly traced consumers of the batch, stopped further endorsement of vaccines from the same batch, and announced their efforts in resolving the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the vaccines had not implemented &lt;i&gt;product citizenship, &lt;/i&gt;whereby they are not given any identity related to their batch, &lt;b&gt;Moderna will have to call back all distributed vaccine kits and contact every single person who has gotten the shots&lt;/b&gt;. By doing this, Moderna would have to bear major losses from the products already distributed and from conducting quality tests on all products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The users and prospects might also lose trust and respect towards the COVID-19 product, then spread their disappointment to the public. If that happens, they can simply switch their trust from Moderna to its rivals which can result in more losses from projected revenue and reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in this case, &lt;b&gt;Moderna only needed to take action on the affected &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;bad product citizens&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; which saved Moderna from all the possible losses&lt;/b&gt;, thanks to &lt;i&gt;product citizenship&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Counterfeit Products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real case study of how counterfeits can greatly damage a brand can be illustrated by the rivalry between ‘Minyak Herba Asmak Mujarab (MHAM)’ and ‘Minyak Herba Asma Mujarab (Original)’. &lt;a href="https://mham.com.my/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;MHAM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; released an ointment suggested to relieve asthma. This ointment was promoted through Facebook in early 2016 and rapidly gained popularity around &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/minyakherbaasma/posts/589679074525197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;June 2016&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in July 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MinyakHerbaAsmaMujarabAsli/photos/a.1135786449820187/1145161032216062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;a Facebook page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was created with a similar name, ‘Minyak Herba Asma Mujarab (Original)’ promoting an almost identical ointment to MHAM’s, with an extra feature of scannable QR code to ‘prove’ its authenticity on the ointment’s label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter product gained such a strong customer base that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MinyakHerbaAsmaMujarabAsli/photos/a.1135786449820187/1182535755145256" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;they claimed the ointment that was released by MHAM as a counterfeit of theirs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To counter that issue, MHAM decided to legally &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/minyakherbaasma/photos/a.524516181041487/624264961066608"&gt;&lt;b&gt;rebrand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from ‘Minyak Herba Asma Mujarab’ to ‘Minyak Herba Asmak Mujarab’ or ‘MHAM’ in September 2016, and completely changed the look of the ointment’s packaging. A year later in September 2017, MHAM announced its authenticity through &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/minyakherbaasma/posts/808738265952609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;legal notification with the Malaysian Ministry of Health&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the damage was done. To make it worse, ‘Minyak Herba Asma Mujarab (Original)’ used the situation to strengthen their position by mentioning that they are the original one since they have never changed their look. However, since MHAM was already legally registered, unlike ‘Minyak Herba Asma Mujarab (Original)’, they stopped attacking MHAM and instead of claiming each other as fakes, both brands became rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, MHAM’s product, version July 2016 contributed a bad reputation to the brand itself for one major reason: the product and brand were not yet &lt;a href="http://cjam.info/en/difference-copyright-and-patent/#:~:text=Patents%20refer%20to%20an%20invention,%20whereas%20copyrights%20refer,works.%20Copyright.%20Copyrights%20protect%20the%20expression%20of%20ideas." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;patented&lt;/a&gt; and registered that they cannot take any legal action against the counterfeit brand. &lt;b&gt;Since the ointment did not implement &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;product citizenship&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, a counterfeiter took advantage of the product’s good reputation and claimed to be its original owner&lt;/b&gt;. In this case, &lt;b&gt;even though that version of the product was authentic, it was a &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;bad citizen.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Products attached to bad publicity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a piece of fake or twisted information is spread on a brand’s product, most of the time, the brand or the product has done nothing wrong. According to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EteDzeeZXk4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Madison College Library&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one may create fake news for satire, influencing public opinion, or gaining personal profit from clickbait. However, if your product does become a victim of fake news or wild rumors, no matter how bad the product’s reputation has become, the implementation of product citizenship can help your brand to gain a second chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2014, Malaysian Muslims were outraged when information leaked that two samples from Cadbury’s chocolate bars were contaminated with porcine DNA, even though they were halal-certified. For Muslims, pigs and their derivatives are forbidden to be consumed, so this incident was circulated as an act to disrespect Muslim’s faith. So, at that time, the products were more contaminated from the sentiment instead of the traces of pork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Cadbury Malaysia acted fast by &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/CadburyMalaysia/posts/729333280443613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;informing the situation about the public&lt;/a&gt; and recalling the specifically affected batches and product variations, before conducting thorough tests of the product samples. It took about a month to clear up the case and validate their halal certificate, and it was a longer road to gain back public trust from the sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, at least Cadbury Malaysia only had to recall the affected batches of &lt;i&gt;bad product citizens&lt;/i&gt; instead of all chocolate bars they sold. If the products were not given any identification, Cadbury Malaysia probably would take a lot longer and spend more resources to fix the disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_0_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Now, you may wonder how can a &lt;i&gt;bad citizen&lt;/i&gt; be &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; bad.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="damage-from-bad-citizen" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_3 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84410 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Article-1-damage.png?resize=1080%2C608&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="608" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the three mentioned cases of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccines, MHAM’s ointment, and Cadbury Malaysia’s chocolate bars, it can be seen that &lt;i&gt;bad product citizens&lt;/i&gt; can imply extensive damage to the brand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create trauma &amp;#38; distrust: &lt;a href="http://www.shipulski.com/2009/12/09/lack-of-product-robustness-can-damage-your-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customers would stop buying the same product when the purchase experience is not as their expectations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and they are very likely to spread the bad news to their family, friends, or everyone on their social media circle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cut revenue: Just being late a few weeks can bring down the entire reputation of your brand. Fixing it will definitely be &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimblasingame/2017/01/27/two-reasons-quality-service-can-take-you-down/?sh=6f2620845d4f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;costly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, if there is still a chance to be fixed, that is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Damage brand’s overall reputation: The reaction of the brand towards a bad product, in terms of the speed and manner is &lt;a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/reputation-risk-how-to-help-mitigate-damage-to-your-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;perceived as the brand’s care and attention to its customers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If a &lt;i&gt;bad citizen&lt;/i&gt; keep popping out repetitively or not quickly seized, a connotated impression that the brand does not care about its consumer will be embedded into the brand’s name for a long time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_1_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;How can Product Citizenship protect your brand against &lt;i&gt;bad citizens&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="protect-against-bad-citizen" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_4 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84411 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Article-1-protect.png?resize=1080%2C608&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="608" data-recalc-dims="1" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, product citizenship is a system that gives identity to their products, which can &lt;b&gt;both protect and promote their brand&lt;/b&gt;. With product citizenship, they can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly identify a malfunctioning product and make appropriate responses to stop its impact on your brand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gain insights on products with high or low demands, then use the information to focus on the promotion of &lt;i&gt;good citizens&lt;/i&gt;, which will help to increase your company’s overall revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be trusted regarding authenticity and quality assurance of your product, since they are well-informed about the product’s identification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn how they can gain customer’s trust &lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they are thinking of ways to avoid &lt;i&gt;bad citizens &lt;/i&gt;in the first place, they can consider these steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Separate the production process&lt;/b&gt; of their products &lt;a href="https://arapackelaw.com/trademarks/how-to-deal-with-knock-offs-trying-to-ruin-your-products-and-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;to avoid anyone knowing the whole manufacturing process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This step can help to reduce the likelihood of counterfeits on their product&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use smart packaging to make it easier and faster to track and record the products. Barcodes and QR codes are examples of smart packaging. Learn more on how to implement smart packaging &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/product-citizenship-series-how-to-implement-smart-packaging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give each of their products an individual registration to keep records and easy identification of the characteristics. This step is beneficial if there is a reported case of a faulty product and they would want to prevent it from happening again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track every single product to easily trace any batch of bad products, just like how Moderna tracks their COVID-19 vaccines so that they can identify any other affected victims of a bad product. Nowadays, there are a lot of tracking technologies you can use, such as &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/radio-frequency-identification-rfid.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;RFID&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/what-is-nfc/#:~:text=What%20is%20NFC?%20NFC%20stands%20for%20near-field%20communication,devices.%20It%20evolved%20from%20radio-frequency%20identification%20(RFID)%20technology." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;NFC&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/revolutionize-your-customers-shopping-experience-with-product-qr-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;QR code&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constantly and consistently engage with users so that they can help report any faulty product, and so that they can immediately share their concern and responsible actions to seize it. Thye can add &lt;a href="https://www.hubspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;HubSpot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s live chat feature to their website to let their customers or prospects reach you easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds like a lot to be done, but it is better to be invested in the protection of their products, than spending money to repair the damages from lack of preparation. Alternatively, they can also find a service that can do all the work for them, like BrandTag, a product by &lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/our-products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;LuxTag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_button_module_wrapper et_pb_button_2_wrapper et_pb_button_alignment_center et_pb_module "&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Introducing BrandTag!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="brandtag" class="et_pb_module et_pb_text et_pb_text_5 et_pb_text_align_left et_pb_bg_layout_light"&gt;
&lt;div class="et_pb_text_inner"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-84412 size-full" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.luxtag.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/brandtag-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&amp;#38;ssl=1" alt="" width="691" height="363" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://brandtag.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;BrandTag&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is one of LuxTag’s Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that can protect and promote your products from the effects of &lt;i&gt;bad citizens &lt;/i&gt;with an easy-to-learn-and-apply system. The three main features of BrandTag include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/product-citizenship-give-your-products-an-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Giving each product identification or ID&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that stores information such as ingredients and story that is accessible to end-users without needing a physical card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/track-trace-system-and-the-blockchain-technology-main-challenges-and-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tracking &amp;#38; tracing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the history of each product to validate the authenticity of your product and to allow you to see how far your product goes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.luxtag.io/blog/brandtag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engaging directly with consumers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without the mediation of a third party, helping you to resolve any issue before it leaks to the public&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead of subscribing to multiple and costly services, they can get all the features to help them against &lt;i&gt;bad citizens&lt;/i&gt; within weeks of implementation time. Remember, just like insurance coverage, the faster they act, the more protected they  will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That’s what the Chilean company Bimtrazer is working to change, powered by Symbol from &lt;a href="https://nem.io/"&gt;NEM&lt;/a&gt; blockchain technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://symbolplatform.com/bimtrazer-case-study/"&gt;Bimtrazer&lt;/a&gt; is a platform that applies AI to optimize the construction plan and articulates it in blocks. Professionals take snapshots of the progress that is tokenized and associated with the code blocks, helping architects, surveyors, builders or inspectors track material use, preventing possible inefficiencies and reducing build costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once each stage of the construction is finished, the progress is tokenized and registered in the &lt;a href="https://symbolplatform.com/enterprise/"&gt;Symbol blockchain&lt;/a&gt; – guaranteeing their integrity and immutability. The serialization and synchronization of these data blocks into the project plan allows decision-makers to track real-time progress. This transparency allows them to stick to the budget and always be ready for any problem they might find on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="bimtrazer-is-launching-its-first-building-using-constructive-traceability-on-symbol-the-new-nem-blockchain-"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bimtrazer is launching its first building using constructive traceability on Symbol, the new NEM Blockchain.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.grupoproaco.com.ar/emprendimientos/opera-park-caracteristicas-_ec9.html"&gt;Ópera Park&lt;/a&gt; is the name of the set of four towers built by the &lt;a href="https://www.grupoproaco.com.ar/"&gt;Proaco&lt;/a&gt;group on a plot of 19,750 m2. Located in Córdoba, in Argentina. This work-in-progress will end up with a total of 40,000 m2 of construction divided into luxury condominiums with 402 apartments, pools, gyms, and aerobic circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/symbol/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25154957/OPERAPARK-INGLES-1-1024x576.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Bimtrazer launches first building using constructive traceability with Symbol"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"&gt;&lt;img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/symbol/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/25154937/Carpeto%CC%81n-Resen%CC%83a-informativa-03-11-20jpg_Page11-1-1024x724.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Bimtrazer launches first building using constructive traceability with Symbol"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimtrazer will record Ópera Park’s progress on NEM’s new high-speed blockchain Symbol, which provides a powerful integration API and enables atomic exchange between public and private strings. The blockchain will hold progress certification, forecasts, and the materials used, without the possibility of modification. Architectural shielding traceability will allow an immutable record for subsequent technical audits and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-benefits-of-constructive-traceability-with-symbol-from-nem"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits of constructive traceability with Symbol from NEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bimtrazer uses Symbol to replace intuition with science. Thanks to the Symbol traceability, they can optimize resources, save time, and reduce costs. Registering technical data and construction progress in a reliable blockchain like Symbol is also key to increasing the customer’s and investors’ trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find out more &lt;a href="https://symbolplatform.com/bimtrazer-case-study/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about the Bimtrazer use case.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, NEM is writing history with a new chapter of its own &amp;#8211; off springing the long-awaited technology giant &lt;a href="https://symbolplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Symbol blockchain&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href="http://explorer.symbolblockchain.io/blocks/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Nemesis block&lt;/a&gt; taking place shortly after midnight on the 16th of March 2021 at 00:06:25 UTC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial Genesis block started the public chain network, one day was taken into consideration to double-check each step and ensure that everything would certainly work as planned as there was little to no space for anything but precise perfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEM &amp;#38; Symbol Brand Ambassador Jeff McDonald commented on the delay between the first two blocks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network was original spun up with one node and only one block while the team audited all the data. After all checks passed, additional nodes were added with stake, and additional blocks were produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://explorer.symbolblockchain.io/blocks/2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Second Block&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;commenced less than 24 hours later, setting the start of an endless cascade with the second block appearing on the 16th of March at 23:27:21 UTC. Ever since this moment, the Symbol blockchain has been running smoothly without any hiccups and has so far already produced more than 1000 Blocks successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In light of the successful launch Jeff Mcdonald added in: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m thrilled that everything went well today, and I&amp;#8217;m very proud of our team of developers who have been extremely hardworking for several years to achieve today&amp;#8217;s milestone. Everyone in the NEM community and NEM Group did an outstanding job working together to bring us where we are now and accomplish the goal of successfully launching the Symbol Platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to seeing Symbol adopted around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the time of writing, more than 205 Nodes are already running the Symbol network globally and securing its proficient block generation with the new &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nemflash.io/what-is-pos-proof-of-stake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;PoS+&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; consensus mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nemflash.io/nem-symbol-snapshot-completed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Snapshot &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;of every balance in the NEM chain was taken on the 12th of March 2021, enabling everyone who opted in and saved their Mnemonic to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nemtech.github.io/wallets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;access their XYM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; now on the Symbol blockchain. Every balance that has not Opted-in and missed the snapshot can claim their XYM up to 6 years after the genesis block of Symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The module to late claim XYM tokens will be introduced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than five years have passed since the development of Symbol was initiated, back then under the code name &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nemflash.io/catapult-sophisticated-blockchain-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;About Symbol&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbol is a platform built on revolutionary blockchain technology, reinventing the ideal blockchain. Symbol does not only allow for standard peer-to-peer value transfer transactions, but instead does much more – store data, make transactions, prove identity, timestamp documents, and create arbitrary digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As some of you will have seen this morning on Twitter, the issue preventing a March 15th launch was tracked down overnight and root cause identified.

This is clearly great news and the problem is &lt;strong&gt;not related to code or bugs&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="summary-"&gt;Summary:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A network config issue occurred with deployment of the pre-mainnet, it caused a fork on startup and unexpected node behaviour&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This has been identified and fixed and the network auto recovered&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We now reset to the beginning of the sequence in the original post on this thread and there are a small number of steps from here to launch, but they take several hours to work through slowly and methodically&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If we have smooth process from here on, we expect very good news later today and will confirm as soon as we have the information concretely known&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3 id="more-detail-"&gt;More Detail:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have caught up with some of the team now and the summary version is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;We had to add some additional security configuration to avoid account holders connecting to something that looked like Mainnet but wasn’t Mainnet, to avoid confusion and potential phishing activities and well, basically because it wasn’t yet launched or ready&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A problem arose from that config which meant the network had a stuttering start and some nodes forked early which we didn’t expect to had so understand why to be confident with the launch sequence for Mainnet and that we didn’t have an issue. We now are.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fantastic news from a stability perspective is that when the config was rectified, the chain came back together on its own as designed, which means it auto recovered from the fork on its own&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of next steps, this happened on the first point of my original post, the sequence from here is therefore exactly the same, but is starting earlier in the day (UTC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in the process of resetting the pre-mainnet (fake mainnet) so the final automation run can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the remaining steps run smoothly, we anticipate very good news later today, but there are still several hours work ahead of the team befor that can be confirmed&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The network did start, finality started and was operational, however there were a few things that are probably best described as stutters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time appears probable to be environmental/deployment/network security related but that won’t be known until it is further assessed and a reproduction/resolution path is identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cross timezone teams will continue through the night and then into the morning tomorrow to resolve this and we will provide a further update before 16.00 UTC 16/03/2021 - whether there is further information or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining steps in the launch sequence remain the same - identify and resolve this hiccup, reset the fake network and follow the same process outlined previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not the news anyone wants to hear, not least those people who have been working long hours for several days/weeks and it is a difficult choice. However it is the right path forward to ensure the network launches stably, securely and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decision was taken and backed unanimously between the Core Developers, Test team and NGL Exec.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posted: 16/03/2021 02:20&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, NEM is writing history with the Symbol snapshot occurring on Block 3.105.500 or 12th of March 2021 at 04:26:34 UTC. Everyone who has had XEM in their wallet at this precious block is&amp;#46;&amp;#46;&amp;#46;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io/nem-symbol-snapshot-completed/"&gt;NEM &amp;#8211; SYMBOL Snapshot is completed&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://nemflash.io"&gt;NEM News Website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded>&lt;div id="attachment_4378" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4378" class="wp-image-4378 size-full" src="http://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-web.png" alt="Symbol Snapshot" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-web.png 1024w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-web-300x200.png 300w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-web-768x512.png 768w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-web-520x347.png 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-4378" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Symbol snapshot occurred today on the 12th of March 2021 at 04:26:34 UTC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today, NEM is writing history with the Symbol snapshot occurring on Block 3.105.500 or 12th of March 2021 at 04:26:34 UTC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;Everyone who has had XEM in their wallet at this precious block is now entitled to own the same amount of XYM, the native token for Symbol, on the new Symbol blockchain. The Symbol mainnet will start with it’s Genesis block &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;on the 15th of March 2021&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;At best, ownership has already been claimed by completing the (pre-snapshot) Opt-in. Nonetheless, it will be possible to claim Symbol’s Token XYM up to 6 years after the launch of the Symbol mainnet – as long there were XEM tokens in the wallet at snapshot block height.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-preserver-spaces="true"&gt;For this purpose, NEM Group will set up a vehicle to ensure proper distribution for late claimers. Details on how this will work exactly have yet to be announced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_4381" style="width: 1143px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4381" class="wp-image-4381 size-full" src="http://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-Screenshot-2021-03-12-12-36-17.png" alt="Symbol snapshot" width="1133" height="29" srcset="https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-Screenshot-2021-03-12-12-36-17.png 1133w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-Screenshot-2021-03-12-12-36-17-300x8.png 300w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-Screenshot-2021-03-12-12-36-17-1024x26.png 1024w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-Screenshot-2021-03-12-12-36-17-768x20.png 768w, https://nemflash.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Symbol-Snapshot-Screenshot-2021-03-12-12-36-17-520x13.png 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1133px) 100vw, 1133px" /&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-4381" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot from the &lt;a href="https://explorer.nemtool.com/#/blocklist" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NEM Blockchain Explorer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to data from the Symbol Countdown Website, a total of 4.338.691.516 or 48,2076% out of a total 8.999.999.999 XEM have participated in the Opt-in procedure. All of these will be included in the Genesis block of Symbol. The amount of the opted-in XEM tokens is distributed over 31.122 separate NEM addresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, a little bit more than half or 4.661.308.483, out of all the XEM not having opted-in, remains to be claimed with the launch of the Symbol chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the immense public interest, several websites and block explorers experienced slowdowns and short periods of time outs due to the massive traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NEM community has been awaiting this moment for several years. Now, the launch of the Symbol chain is only a few mere days away – the faith and hopes are high that the transition will go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, data from CMC shows a drop in the XEM price of about -25% compared to the last 24 hours, with the satoshi price dropping from 1050 satoshis to, as of date, 770 satoshis. So far, the drop resulting from the Symbol snapshot has been much smaller in impact than anticipated by most people of the NEM community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it shows that the NEM community has everything but given up on the matured NEM blockchain with its versatile features. Nonetheless, for short term a further drop is in the range of expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More information about the &lt;a href="https://nemflash.io/future-outlook-nem-nis1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;future of NEM&lt;/a&gt; is anticipated to be made public soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NEM Group announced that it is recommended to wait for 360 blocks until after the snapshot block height to have the Opt-in 100% confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Further information:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

NEM is a time tested blockchain that began as an idea on Bitcointalk. In 7 years, NEM has grown to become a top market cap cryptocurrency without ever experiencing protocol-level security issues, downtime, or lost assets.&lt;br /&gt;
In 2020, NEM Group was created to expand adoption and re-energize the community. The results are now bearing fruit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEM is nearing release of its new blockchain, Symbol.&lt;br /&gt;
Symbol is expected to become a market leader in utility, interoperability, speed, and innovation.&lt;br /&gt;

This date represents a major milestone in the development of Symbol over the last 4 years. This has been achieved following a highly robust and rigorous testing programme – making Symbol probably one of the most tested blockchains prior to launch yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symbol is the next-generation Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain from NEM, boasting enterprise-grade programmability and security. Symbol from NEM brings cutting-edge technical features which can be leveraged by innovative projects building the new economy. The platform enables the creation of specialized digital assets, with configurable properties, and a unique identifier and can enforce logic-based account or asset-based restrictions at a protocol level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about &lt;a href="https://symbolplatform.com/latest/symbol-set-to-launch-15-march-2021"&gt;Symbol launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;NEM (NIS1) Genesis block was started on the 31st of March 2015(from today February 25, 2021) 5 years 10 months and 26 days ago. In this time it has shown to be a very reliable platform with fast transactions, solid features and very low fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the upcoming &lt;a href="https://nemflash.io/symbol-launch-snapshot-launch-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Launch of Symbol (XYM)&lt;/a&gt; on March 15th, all of this will be enhanced and expanded. But what does this mean in regards to the future outlook for NEM (NIS1)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Come and join the discussion with &lt;a href="https://nemflash.io/introducing-kristy-leigh-minehan-cto-nem-software/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Kristy-Leigh Minehan&lt;/a&gt;, scheduled for tomorrow &amp;#8211;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;February 26th 1300 UTC, on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/NEMofficial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously Head of the NEM Group David Shaw highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://forum.nem.io/t/nis1-strategy-approach/26604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;NEM Forum post&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;considerable thought was given to NIS1 alongside the preparation for Symbol launch&amp;#8221;. &lt;/em&gt;He addressed three critical key areas in order to keep NIS1 successful and ensure its continuity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, it is planned to create a dedicated Trust which will solely invest in improving NIS1. Second, the product life of NIS1 needs to be addressed by improving the software and preparing a proper roadmap, which requires product and technical management to be hired for its maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the Supernode Reward Programme needs to be refilled with an additional transfer of funds to ensure that the network is secured by high performance VPS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is expected that a POI vote will decide on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same forum&amp;#8217;s thread &amp;#8211; Mrs. Minehan similarly emphasized the importance of a dedicated product manager for NIS1 who will work closely together with her. Documentation needs to be updated and expanded &amp;#8211; NIS1 could do well with its core modules being updated. User experience and Interface in the &lt;a href="https://nemplatform.com/wallets/#mobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Nanowallet&lt;/a&gt; will be addressed and unified. A path to open source NIS1 ẃill be discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it stands, NEM and Symbol will be both running in their own ways and we can be faithful that both may facilitate many transactions with the technologies being used to their highest respective potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen how the two blockchains can work in tandem and if the NEM Group can achieve balance in the difficult act of being community driven but business oriented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;About NEM (NIS1)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NEM Blockchain boasts a runtime of already close to six years and counting. The complimentary Nanowallet features already a host of functionalities with all of them working solid without a break. For endeavors which only require a limited functionality, NEM NIS1 can still be a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most prominent features include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PoI &amp;#38; Whitelisting Voting module&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-signature Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mosaics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namespaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apostille Module Notary Service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harvesting &amp;#38; Delegated Harvesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plain &amp;#38; encrypted messaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Address Book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trezor support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline Transactions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
